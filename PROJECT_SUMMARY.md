# Aphasia Type Classifier - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning solution for classifying aphasia types (BROCA vs WERNICKE) from speech transcription data. It includes multiple classification algorithms and an interactive web application for real-time predictions.

## 🚀 What We've Accomplished

### 1. Multiple Classification Models Implemented

We've successfully implemented and compared **5 different classification algorithms**:

1. **Logistic Regression** - Fast, interpretable linear classifier
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Robust kernel-based classifier  
3. **Random Forest** - Ensemble method with feature importance
4. **Naive Bayes** - Probabilistic classifier optimized for text
5. **Neural Network** - Deep learning model with 4 hidden layers

### 2. Model Performance Results

Based on the comparative analysis:

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Training Time | Prediction Time |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 0.0022s | 0.0074s |
| **Random Forest** | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 0.0880s | 0.0030s |
| **Naive Bayes** | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 0.0065s | 0.0007s |
| **SVM** | 90.91% | 92.42% | 90.91% | 90.91% | 0.0163s | 0.0015s |
| **Neural Network** | 45.45% | 20.66% | 45.45% | 28.41% | 2.8752s | 0.0350s |

**Best Performing Model**: Logistic Regression (tied with Random Forest and Naive Bayes)
